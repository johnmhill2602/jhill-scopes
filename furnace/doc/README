Dear Oven Pilots,
	I have just completed updating the series of oven help files
that are not a permanent part of the mirror package.  I have also
installed a better way to access them.  Now when you log on as pilot on
crater or dorado, you can say "help topic" or better "phelp topic" to
read the help pages about topic.  To print the help file say "help
topic |lpr".

The available topics are:
clocks config menus minutemap logbook lvdt pilot_login pilot_short remote 
schedules simul_login trouble user_login wait_states furnace

These are in addition to the usual topics from the mirror package:
odisp ograph oven ovenb ovend ovene oveng ovenp ovenr ovenw tcmark xytran

The topics that have changed significantly you will want to read:
pilot_login, pilot_short, simul_login, trouble, lvdt

Please send me email if you find errors or if you can suggest clearer 
explanations.
						Ciao,
							John



Read on to learn the mechanics of how I did it.

I have assembled all the help files in an external IRAF package of mine
called scopes.furnace.  It lives in /u/hill/scopes/furnace/.
This allows me to edit the files without reinstalling skip's mirror package.
Thus the old help files in /u/pilot/PROCEDURES are now obsolete.
In the pilot's loginuser.cl file, I have added the appropriate lines
to that the scopes helpdb.mip (help database) is attached to the pilot 
helpdb list.
